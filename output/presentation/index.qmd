::: {.notes}
Acoustic signals serve as a key means through which animals convey information to conspecifics and navigate their social and ecological landscapes. Animal sounds are expected to be finely tuned by natural selection to maximize their effectiveness within specific ecological contexts (Bradbury & Vehrencamp 2011). This selective process acting on acoustic signals is closely linked to the propagation of sound through natural environments and the challenges it entails. Transmission in natural settings can substantially impact signal integrity, potentially affecting their likelihood of detection and the successful transfer of information (Morton 1975; Marten and Marler 1977). As such, detailed insights into the complex interplay between animal acoustic signals and the physical environments in which they are emitted are critical for furthering our understanding of the mechanistic basis in the evolution of animal acoustic communication (Endler 1992; Cardoso and Price 2009; Tobias et al. 2014).

## Sound degradation experiments


::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Quantify change in sound structure in a given habitat
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds at increasing distances
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Degradation affects communication potential
:::

::: {.notes}
Sound transmission experiments have been a key tool for evaluating the interaction of signals with their natural environments. Transmission studies seek to test hypotheses related to degradation of animal sounds over space in combination with environmental factors that influence selection on signal form and function (Grabarczyk & Gill 2020; Graham et al 2017). Typically, this is achieved by broadcasting and re-recording animal sounds or synthesized sounds at increasing distances, then quantifying change in structural components, by measuring the modification of power distribution in time and frequency domains and on combined time-frequency representations of sound (reviewed by Hardt & Benedict 2020). Such experiments have provided valuable insight into factors that affect signal transmission in natural environments. For instance, both habitat and acoustic structure can affect transmission in a significant manner (Kime et al. 2000; Apol et al. 2017; Wheeldon et al. 2022). In addition, other factors such as anthropogenic noise masking (Leader et al. 2005; LaZerte et al. 2015; Grabarczyk & Gill 2020), distance of the signaler from the ground, which leads to additional attenuation (Balsby et al. 2003; Darden et al. 2008; Arasco et al. 2022), as well as ambient temperature, humidity, and wind speed (Bradbury & Vehrencamp 2011) also influence transmission patterns.

## Conducting experiments

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Several steps:

    - formatting/manipulation files
    - broadcasting/re-recording in natural settings
    - annotation re-recorded files
    - quantifying degradation measures 
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Difficulties have likely contributed to their limited implementation
:::

::: {.notes}
Conducting sound transmission experiments, however, can be challenging. Several steps are involved, such as careful formatting and manipulation of audio files, broadcasting and re-recording study signals in natural settings, annotation of re-recorded files, and quantification of degradation measures. These difficulties have likely contributed to the limited implementation of such experiments in animal communication research.

## R package `baRulho` {background="#31688EFF"}


Facilitate implementing (animal) sound degradation experiments:


::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Generating synthesized sounds
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Creating playback sound files
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Streamlining annotating and measuring re-recorded sounds
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
- Explore/quantify sound degradation
:::

::: {.notes}
Here, we introduce the R package ‘baRulho’ (Portuguese for ‘noise’), which is intended to facilitate animal sound transmission experiments and their subsequent analysis. The package offers tools to help researchers at each step of the process, from generating synthesized sounds and creating playback sound files, to streamlining annotation and measurement of sound degradation in re-recorded signals.

<font color = "#FD9567"><b>Effects of habitat and signal structure on transmission using synthesized sounds</b></font>

- Bosque de Tlalpan, Mexico City (Xeric Shrubland / Oak Fsorest)

![](images/tlalpan.jpg){.absolute top="400" left="100" width="700" height="300"}

::: {.notes}
We highlight package features with a case study testing the effects of habitat and signal structure on transmission properties using synthesized sounds. In addition, as proof of concept, we compared baRulho's output to that of Sigpro (Pedersen 1998), the most commonly used software for quantifying sound degradation.
